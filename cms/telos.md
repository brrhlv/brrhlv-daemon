# TELOS Framework

A structured approach to understanding problems, defining missions, setting goals, and measuring progress.

## Problems

The fundamental issues I see in the world that need addressing.

### P1: People lack clarity about themselves
- Most don't know what they want or why
- Living on autopilot without examining their direction
- No framework for self-discovery and purpose

### P2: People struggle to scale their growth
- Learning feels like a chore rather than exploration
- No systems for compounding personal development
- Don't understand how the world really works

### P3: Small businesses lack modern web solutions
- Trapped in expensive agency contracts ($5K+ for basic sites)
- DIY builders limit growth and flexibility
- No ownership or control over their digital presence
- Need affordable solutions they actually own

## Missions

My response to these problems through focused action.

### M1: Help people find clarity
- Guide self-discovery through conversation and frameworks
- Share what I learn about purpose and direction
- Build tools that help people understand themselves better

### M2: Provide clarity, trust, and control (AliraLink)
- Payment systems that business owners actually understand
- Transparency over fees and processes
- Help them save time and keep more of their income

### M3: Democratize professional web development
- **Transparency:** Free template demos so prospects see exactly what they're getting
- **Ownership:** GitHub-based development - clients own their code and can leave anytime
- **Affordability:** $500 setup (vs $5K+ agencies) with optional maintenance
- **Modern Stack:** Headless WordPress/WooCommerce + Vercel for fast, scalable sites

## Narratives

The stories I tell myself about who I am.

### N1: The Possibility Spotter
I see the potential in things before they exist - in people, in ideas, in businesses. What looks like chaos to others, I see as a canvas. My gift is making the invisible visible, translating "what if" into "here's how."

### N2: The Creative Catalyst
Every problem is an adventure in disguise. I don't just solve things - I help people see constraints as creative challenges. The energy of figuring things out, exploring possibilities together, building something new - that's where I come alive.

### N3: The Deep Connector
Real work happens in real relationship. I build things WITH people, not FOR them. The collaboration itself matters. I'd rather win together than succeed alone - the journey is as important as the destination.

### Core Thread
I'm an explorer at heart - of ideas, cultures, possibilities. I teach what I discover. I build with those going the same direction. The web is my medium. Connection is my purpose.

## Metrics

How I measure progress.

| Metric | What It Measures |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Reach** | Content views, tool usage, people helped |
| **Impact** | Success stories, client outcomes, real change |
| **Quality** | Depth of engagement, return visitors, referrals |
| **Innovation** | New tools created, problems solved, frameworks developed |

*TELOS is a living framework that evolves as I learn and grow. The point isn't rigid adherence - it's having a north star to guide decisions and actions.*
