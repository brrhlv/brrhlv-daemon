[ABOUT]

My name is Bryan Rivera (brrh.lv) and I'm a web developer, strategist, and builder based out of Las Vegas. I run AliraLink, helping small businesses and solopreneurs get professional websites they actually own.

I'm an ENFP-T who sees potential in things before they exist - in people, in ideas, in businesses. The web is my medium. Connection is my purpose.

I spend my time building websites, exploring AI-augmented workflows, and helping people find clarity about what they're building and why.

[CURRENT_LOCATION]

Las Vegas, Nevada

[MISSION]

Help people find clarity about themselves, their goals, and the world, so they can make better-informed decisions and scale their growth purposefully. Explore ideas, teach what I discover, build with those on the same path.

[PURPOSE]

TELOS Framework - A structured approach to understanding problems, defining missions, setting goals, and measuring progress.

Problems:
- P1: People lack clarity about themselves - living on autopilot without examining their direction
- P2: People struggle to scale their growth - learning feels like a chore, no systems for compounding development
- P3: Small businesses lack modern web solutions - trapped in expensive agency contracts or limited DIY builders

Missions:
- M1: Help people find clarity - guide self-discovery through conversation and frameworks
- M2: Provide clarity, trust, and control (AliraLink) - payment systems business owners understand
- M3: Democratize professional web development - transparency, ownership, affordability

Narratives:
- The Possibility Spotter: I see potential before it exists - in people, ideas, businesses
- The Creative Catalyst: Every problem is an adventure in disguise
- The Deep Connector: Real work happens in real relationship

Metrics: Reach | Impact | Quality | Innovation

[PERSONALITY]

ENFP-T | The Campaigner

- The Possibility Spotter: I see potential in things before they exist - in people, in ideas, in businesses. What looks like chaos to others, I see as a canvas.
- The Creative Catalyst: Every problem is an adventure in disguise. I don't just solve things - I help people see constraints as creative challenges.
- The Deep Connector: Real work happens in real relationship. I build things WITH people, not FOR them. The collaboration itself matters.

Core Thread: I'm an explorer at heart - of ideas, cultures, possibilities. I teach what I discover. I build with those going the same direction. The web is my medium. Connection is my purpose.
